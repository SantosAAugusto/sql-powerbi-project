# Description
This project aims to guide how to connect an SQLite Database to Power BI.
This is necessary because Power BI does not natively support direct connections to SQLite.
Therefore, the installation of an ODBC driver and the connection between the driver and the database are required.
Afterward, it will be possible to connect the SQLite database through the ODBC option in Power BI Desktop.
Once the connection is established, the tables present in the database will be available in Power BI, and the dashboard can be built.

## Driver Installation
The ODBC Driver can be found in the following link: [ODBC Driver](https://www.devart.com/odbc/sqlite/).

Notice: there's a free trial. In case you or your company want to use for a long period, you have to pay for it.
For our explanation, there's no need to pay, but you will only have 30 days of using.
